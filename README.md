My writing techniques are always to begin by determining what I want to write about. Following the point on what I want to write about I begin to determine my main points that I'd like to cover. After creating my main points I search for supporting evidence about my topics main points that proves my statements.  Next, I begin adding more statements about my main points to describe in more detail my discussion.
